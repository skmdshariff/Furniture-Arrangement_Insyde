Furniture Arrangement AI

This project optimizes furniture placement in a room using AI, ensuring an efficient and aesthetic arrangement based on user input.

Overview

•	Users can choose between a Bedroom or Hall layout.

•	Furniture is arranged based on predefined rules:

o	Bedroom: Bed placed against a wall or corner, TV unit aligned to the bed and attached to the wall, cupboard placed at an edge/corner, chair, and table positioned randomly.

o	Hall: Sofa positioned at the extreme edge or corner, TV unit aligned with the sofa and attached to the wall, cupboard placed at an edge/corner, table positioned randomly.

•	The layout is visualized using Matplotlib.

Features

•	Optimized Layouts: Ensures a realistic and functional room setup.

•	Automatic Placement: Positions furniture based on space constraints.

•	User Input Driven: Asks the user whether they are designing a bedroom or hall.

•	Graphical Representation: Displays the final furniture arrangement using Matplotlib.
